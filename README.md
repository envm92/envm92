# Hi, I'm Erika Valdes 👋

### Frontend Software Engineer · Redmond, WA

I'm a frontend engineer with 6+ years of experience building responsive, high-performance web and mobile applications. I love crafting clean, intuitive user interfaces and designing solutions from scratch — from architecture decisions to pixel-perfect details.

Currently focused on **TypeScript**, **Angular**, and **Web Components**, with a passion for creating tools that genuinely help people.

## 💙 Community & Mentorship

I care deeply about making tech more inclusive. From **Feb 2023 to Jun 2024**, I volunteered as a **Code Coach at [Laboratoria](https://www.laboratoria.la/)**, mentoring **100+ women across Latin America** in frontend development — helping them build their first projects, prepare for technical interviews, and launch careers in tech.

## 🎮 A little about me

When I'm not coding, I'm probably playing **Minecraft** — a game I've loved since 2011. I'm fascinated by the intersection of gaming, creativity, and technology, and I believe the best products are built by people who genuinely care about the experiences they create.
